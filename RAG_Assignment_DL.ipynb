      "📝 Answer:\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "One of the primary challenges in neural network optimization is ill-conditioning as mentioned by Blum and Rivest (1992), which can cause \"SGD to get stuck\" because even small steps may significantly increase the cost function. This issue arises due to problems with the Hessian matrix being positive semidefinite, leading to saddle points where local minima are not global ones:\n",
      "> Some theoretical results show that there exist problem classes that are intractable (Judd 1989; Wolpert and Macready 1997). Other results indicate finding a solution for a network of a given size is infeasible, but \"in practice we can find a solution easily by using a larger network\" (Blum and Rivest, 1992:4.9-50; Wolpert and Macready, 1997).\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the nonconvex nature of neural networks presents difficulties as they are not always expressible in terms of convex optimization problems which have stronger guarantees (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004:8.6-8.7):\n",
      "> Convex optimization algorithms can provide many more guarantees by making \"stronger restrictions\" but most deep learning problems cannot be expressed as such due to the nonconvex nature of neural networks which lack saddle points (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004:8.6-8.7).\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, designing models that are easier to optimize is crucial for improving optimization algorithms since \"the best strategy\" often involves model improvements rather than just algorithm enhancements (Chapter 8 of the provided document):\n",
      "> To improve optimization, it's not always about better algorithms. Instead, many advances in neural network learning have come from designing models that are easier to optimize by using activation functions with significant slope and linear transformations between layers which reflect a \"design choice\" for modern deep networks (Chapter 8 of the provided document).\n",

      "==================================================\n",
      "Adversarial Training is a technique used in machine learning that involves training two models simultaneously—a generator and a discriminator—in what resembles a zero-sum game. The goal for the generator (g) is to create samples x such that they are indistinguishable from real data by the discriminator, while the discriminator's objective (d) is to accurately distinguish between genuine and generated samples. This process encourages both models to improve their performance through competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The generator receives a negative payoff when its output causes an error in the discriminator: \"The simplest way to formulate learning in generative adversarial networks is as a zero-sum game, in which a functionv(θ( )g ,θ( )d ) determines the payoﬀ of the\n",
      "discriminator.\" (Goodfellow et al. 2014b) The discriminator's reward depends on its ability to correctly classify samples as real or fake: \"The simplest way to formulate learning in generative adversarial networks is as a zero-sum game, where the generator receives −v(θ( )g ,θ( )d ).\" (Goodfellow et al. 2014b)\n",
      "\n",
      "This method has been shown to be effective even when neural network models reach human performance levels on i.i.d. test sets: \"Adversarial examples havemanyimplications, for example, in computersecurity...\" (Szegedy et al. 2014a). However, the technique also reveals that these networks may not truly understand tasks as humans do since they can be easily misled by adversarially crafted inputs: \"Even neural networks that perform at human level accuracy have a nearly 100% error rate on examples...\" (Szegedy et al. 2014a).\n",
